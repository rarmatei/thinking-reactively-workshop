/*
  we'll split it up into two:
  whenever somebody starts a combo
    keep taking(listening) for keys
      until the timer has finished
        explain with clock 
      and while the combo is being followed correctly
        show us missing the 3rd key
      and until we've reached the end of the combo
        the first two conditions are filters
        we'll only get values here if the user has been correctly following the combo
        

      explain them on by one in PP
      WE ENTER COMBO mode
      that's why we separate them - because now we can think only about
        what's make us exit combo mode
