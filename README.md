# Thinking Reactively with RxJS - Egghead.io Workshop

##Pre-requisites

#####Intro for beginners:
[Introduction to Reactive Programming](https://egghead.io/courses/introduction-to-reactive-programming)

#####Operators

[RxJS Beyond the Basics - Operators in Depth](https://egghead.io/courses/rxjs-beyond-the-basics-operators-in-depth)
Highly recommended, it explains `scan`, `combineLatest`, `merge`, `startWith` and a few other operators we will use in the course

---

Recommended for understanding the `shareReplay(1)` usage in the workshop and also `Subjects`:
https://egghead.io/courses/rxjs-subjects-and-multicasting-operators

---

Operators we'll be using not covered in the above two courses:
- [distinctUntilChanged](https://www.learnrxjs.io/operators/filtering/distinctuntilchanged.html)
- [pairwise](https://www.learnrxjs.io/operators/combination/pairwise.html)
- [fromEvent](https://egghead.io/lessons/rxjs-convert-dom-and-node-js-streams-to-rxjs-observables-with-fromevent)
- [timer](https://egghead.io/lessons/rxjs-set-intervals-with-rxjs-interval-and-timer-operators)
- [new Observable](https://egghead.io/lessons/rxjs-understand-the-rxjs-create-operator)
- [takeUntil](https://egghead.io/lessons/rxjs-stopping-a-stream-with-takeuntil)
- [takeWhile](https://egghead.io/lessons/rxjs-completing-a-stream-with-takewhile)

#####Promises
[Understanding the ES6 Promise API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)

#####Bonus / Further learning

All around incredibly good course around higher order observables and different merging strategies in RxJS:
